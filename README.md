# ClimaCell Core

Some unofficial code to run a request against the ClimaCell API (http://api.climacell.co). This code is in alpha state, I'm a novice programmer and I'm new to C# and Github, so this code may not be considered as high-quality code. Feel free to contribute, fork or use this code on your own repository.

## Acknowledgments

This code is mainly based on the [DarkSkyCore](https://github.com/amweiss/dark-sky-core/) library of Adam Weiss and was originally created because the DarkSkyCore api has been discontinued and there was no existing library for requesting information from the ClimaCell api.
